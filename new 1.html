	   <p style="font-size:20px; color:green; text-align:justify">The history of pictures progressed from ancient optical concepts to modern digital imagery.
	   The journey began with the camera 
	   obscura, a dark room with a pinhole 
	   that projected an inverted image, understood since antiquity. In the 18th century, 
	   scientists like Johann Heinrich Schulze discovered that silver salts 
	   darkened when exposed to light, but couldn't make the images permanent.
The breakthrough came in the 19th century. Joseph Nicéphore Niépce created the 
first permanent photograph, View from the Window at Le Gras, around 1826. His 
partner, Louis Daguerre, later developed the daguerreotype, which produced 
sharper, though non-reproducible, images. In 1841, William Henry Fox Talbot
 patented the calotype, a negative-positive paper process that enabled multiple
 prints. Later innovations, such as Frederick Scott Archer's wet collodion
 process, further improved quality.
In 1888, George Eastman's Kodak camera made photography accessible to 
amateurs with the slogan, "You press the button, we do the rest". Color 
photography followed, with the Lumière brothers' Autochrome plates released in 1907.
 The ultimate revolution, however, was digital. The first digital image was created
 in 1957, and the first digital camera prototype was built in 1975 by 
 Kodak engineer Steven Sasson. By the 1990s, digital cameras became
 commercially available, eventually dominating the market and placing 
 powerful cameras into virtually every modern smartphone. </p>
